		<h2>Who We Are</h2>
		<p><strong>The National Concert Venue in New York City doesn't exist.</strong> But if it did, it would be one of the largest and most exciting art venues in the world. Able to put on a range of events, such as concerts, plays, ballet and dance, it offers a chance for people of all ages and backgrounds to immerse themselves in the world of performing arts.</p>
		<p>The trustees of the National Concert Venue want to hear what customers like (or do not like) about the venue and it's shows. They hand out feedback cards, and include a link to this website's Boomerang page in confirmation emails. They are serious about improving.</p>
		<p style="font-style: italic">If your company or organisation is also serious about improving, you need to gather feedback. This demo will show you how Boomerang can play a part in that. Take a look around, then head over to the pricing page of <a target="_blank" href="https://canny.io/pricing">Canny</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://frill.co/pricing"> Frill</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.featurebase.app/pricing"> Featurebase</a> or any other feature request or feedback platform. Once you've picked yourself off the floor, head to <a target="_blank" href="https://boomerangwp.com/pricing">ours</a>.</p>
