		<h2>Who We Are</h2>
		<p><strong>The Nashdale Concert Venue in Nashdale, Massachusetts doesn't exist.</strong></p>
		<p>But if it did, it would be one of the most exciting art venues in the world. Very small, but very much loved, it is run and funded entirely by the community and is a non-profit. Able to put on a range of events, such as concerts, plays, ballet and dance, it offers a chance for people of all ages and backgrounds to immerse themselves in the world of performing arts.</p>
		<p>The trustees of the Nashdale Concert Venue want to hear what customers like (or do not like) about the venue and its shows. They hand out feedback cards, and include a link to this website's Boomerang page in confirmation emails. They are serious about improving.</p>
		<p style="font-style: italic">If your company or organisation is also serious about improving, you need to gather feedback. This demo will show you how Boomerang can play a part in that. Take a look around, then head over to the pricing page of Canny, Frill, Featurebase or any other feature request or feedback platform. Once you've picked yourself off the floor, head to <a target="_blank" href="https://boomerangwp.com/pricing">ours</a>.</p>
